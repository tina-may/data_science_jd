About the Role:
We are looking for generalists and specialists in AI/ML techniques including computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and audio signal processing. You will be responsible for partnering with a variety of stakeholders (product, operations, policy, and engineering) and developing state-of-the-art models.

What You'll Need:
- Knowledge of underlying mathematical fundamentals in statistics, machine learning, and analytics.
- Experience with exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis and hypotheses testing, and model development.
- Fluency in SQL, Hive, Presto, or Spark and ability to write efficient code at scale with large datasets.
- Experience using Python or at least one programming language efficiently at scale with large data sets.
- Experience in building and evaluating machine learning models.

What You'll Do:
- Drive clarity and solve ambiguous, challenging business problems using data-driven approaches. Propose and own data analysis (including modeling, coding, analytics, and experimentation) to drive business insight and facilitate decisions.
- Develop creative solutions and build prototypes to business problems using algorithms based on machine learning, statistics, and optimisation.

Qualifications

Basic:
- PhD, M.S. or Bachelors degree in Statistics, Economics, Computer Science or another quantitative field. (If M.S. degree, a minimum of 1+ years of industry experience required and if Bachelor's degree, a minimum of 2+ years of industry experience required.)
- Demonstrated excellence in a relevant AI/ML discipline (CV, NLP, ASR, etc.), including experience with ML model building with libraries such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, and OpenAI
- Knowledge of fundamentals of machine learning, such as algorithm families (regression, classification, unsupervised), AB testing, hypothesis testing, and optimization
Preferred:
- Experience with human-in-the-loop ML, active learning, and data labelling
- Experience with knowledge graphs and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j, triplestores, ontologies, taxonomies)
- Strong communication skills, for example demonstrated through documentation and presentations. Able to present findings to senior management to inform business decisions.
