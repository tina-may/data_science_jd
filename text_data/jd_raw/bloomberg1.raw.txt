The ADSK (Analytics Desk) Engineering team builds and supports Bloomberg's premier customer service system. Our applications handle around 5 million questions per year in several languages and offer 24/7 support to over 300,000 clients around the globe, creating more than a billion rows of chat data. Our team leverages this chat data in a variety of ways to build ML/NLP tools that streamline the interactions between clients and representatives. These tools include
a chatbot that automatically answers client FAQs
an NLP model that will match a client with a representative with the required expertise, depending on the topic of the client's question
algorithms that will surface relevant content to a representative as they are chatting with a client to help the representative answer the client's question
applications that allow business stakeholders to explore what topics clients are asking about and search across client chats.
Our tools combine ML/NLP models, event-driven backend technologies, and internally built solutions (both within our team and from other teams within Bloomberg) to handle various forms of chat text across ADSK. We'll trust you to:
Work with your teammates and our business stakeholders to understand the problems at hand
